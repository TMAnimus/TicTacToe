# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe game asked for by TripleByte

When I first was asked to do a coding interview by TripleByte, they asked me to code up a tic tac toe game. Unfortunately I was dumb enough to do it with Python, which I wasn't nearly as expert in as I thought.

Then again, since I think better without a time limit, I started a project to do just that.

Tic Tac Toe, one-player vs. computer, in Python.
